## Overview
This repository contains the complete SQL scripts and performance diagnostics for Simulation 9 focusing on:
- Legacy cursor logic reconstruction  
- Modernization using set-based SQL  
- Strategic index design to optimize query performance  
- Performance validation with STATISTICS IO / TIME  
All tasks were implemented in SQL Server using the AdventureWorks2019 database and a custom SalesOpsSim schema.

## Scripts Included
- **Task 1:** Schema creation and working tables  
- **Task 2:** Legacy nested cursor implementation  
- **Task 3:** Modernization analysis and diagnostic queries  
- **Task 4:** Modernized set-based implementation  
- **Task 5:** Index strategy (nonclustered, covering, filtered)  
- **Task 6:** Performance tests (cursor vs. set-based vs. indexed)
